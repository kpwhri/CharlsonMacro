# HCSRN Charlson Comorbidity Macro

Calculate the Deyo version of the Charlson Comorbidity Score.

Many thanks to the support of the [HCSRN](http://www.hcsrn.org) and all its associated
programmers for the development of this macro.  As currently constructed, the macro
will run against datasets built to the HCSRN [Virtual Data Warehouse](http://www.hcsrn.org/en/Tools%20&%20Materials/VDW/) common data model.
